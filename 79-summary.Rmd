# Final Words

This booklet is work in progress. 
It will be updated in parallel to the joint learning sessions.

If you have come here before the sessions are completed, be sure to ask for getting an intro to bookdown as one of the advanced sessions.

As discussed in the intro session/section, the R/RStudio Ecosystem is in constant flux.
And there is not a single "learning path" for this journey.
The material presented/discussed and recorded in this booklet will get you going.
And as usual ... the sky is now the limit.

Enjoy your journey with R/RStudio Ecosystem.
Share your experiences and lessons learned and developments.
